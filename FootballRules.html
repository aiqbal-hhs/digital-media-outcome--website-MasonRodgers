<h1>How Football Rules have changed</h1>
<hr>    
<h3>The referee</h3>
<p>Referees were not actually involved until 1871. Instead, the captains of both teams were told to keep order of there team. It was a sport of honesty. Yet in 1871 with the establishment of the FA Cup it was decided that two referees should decide if the captains of each team couldn't agree. Seven years later, the referees to make every call were introduced and the players were astonished at how loud the whistles were at first.

<p>Before the FIFA World Cup in 2018, it was decided that cameras would be used to assist the referees for the first time. The so-called video assistant referees could be used exclusively in decisions concerning goals, penalties and red card.

<h3>The goalkeeper</h3>
<p>In the early days, goalkeeper was not a distinctive position. Not until 1909 did the last man in the team start to wear a different colored shirt. Three years later came the rule that dictated that the goalkeeper was only allowed to touch the balls with his hand inside the box close to his own goal. Before that, the rules concerning this were looser.

<hr>    
    
<h3>Corners</h3>
<p>Corner-kicks were introduced in 1872. In 1924, it was decided that a corner-kick was allowed to go straight into the goal. The rule was taken away not long after that, in a match between Argentina and Uruguay the same year. The Argentina player Ceareo Onzari did the only goal in the match and it was from the corner spot. The goal became famous and was titled "el gol olimpico"  is sometimes used in Spanish-speaking language for a goal made directly on a corner.

<hr>    
    
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>Penalties were introduced in 1891, before that the closest to a penalty was the indirect free kick. At this time the pitches were not marked with penalty areas whiched was introduced in 1902, therefore, a penalty was given if the referee judged that a offence had been made within twelve yards from the goal line.

<p>In 1970, penalty shoot-outs, for deciding a match that was still a draw after full time was officially taken into practice. The same year a penalty-shootout occurred between Hull City and Manchester United in the semi-final of the Watney Cup. The first penalty shoot-out in a World Cup (qualification matches excluded) happened in the 1982, in the semi-final between West Germany and France.

<hr>    
    
<h3>Offside</h3>
<p>During the past century, many various forms of the offside rules have existed. Since the game in one of its earliest forms only included dribbling and not passing at all, an offside rule was originally superfluous.

<p>The first law with a resemblance of offside dictated that passes had to be done either sideways or backwards. Whereas this became the norm for rugby, the game of football took another route when the rule was changed again in 1866. According to this rule, a player was allowed to pass the ball forward providing three players of the opposite team were between the ball and the opponent’s goal.

<p>The rule would result in lack of goals which lead to several rule changes in the first decades of 1900s. The first change happened 1907 and stated that a player could not be offside in his own half. In 1921, another rule was added to make life easier for the attackers by making it impossible to be offside on a throw-in. A further step was taken in favor for the attackers when it was decided that only two instead of three defenders had to be between the ball and the opponent’s goal.

<p>The changes of the offside rules would initially result in more goals, but in the long run it changed the game tactically in a way that more defenders being used.
    
<hr>    

<h3>Extra time</h3>
<p>Before standardization of rules there wasn't a unified regulation concerning extra time. A game in a knockout tournament that was a draw after 90 minutes could be continued with what is know as a golden goal. This means that the first team to score a goal after the 90 minutes would win the game. Although there were a few occasions where noone could score so the game would end up stopping when it was to dark to play. <hr><br><br>
