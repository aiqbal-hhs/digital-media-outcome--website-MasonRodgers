<h2>Intro</h2><!-- Make sure the reader will know what the website is about from this intro -->
    <p>In my website today you are going to learn, how football rules have changed, how football designs have changed, and some facts you might not have already knowm. The first football Cup was made in 1871. But like baseball in the U.S, football existed without a single set of rules for years, played in various forms throughout the country (and the world), primarily by the lower class. However, football came together under a more formalized set of rules due largely to its presence in schools. In 1863, a group of London-based schools came together to draw up an agreed upon set of rules. 11 schools formed the Football Association (FA), and modern football was more or less officially born. In 1871, England saw its first Cup, a competition between various football clubs. 15 clubs participated in the first tourney, with Wanderers winning the first championship. Some of the initial aspects of the game remain today - both sides used 11 men on the pitch and touching the ball with the hands was illegal. Some people would be surprised at how many goals are actually scored. The top 2 goal scorers Ronaldo and Pele are both at around 800 goals. The record for most goals by goalkeepers is done by the Brazilian Rogerio Ceni, with 131 goals, you would be surprised by this but this is because he is the penalty and free kick taker for his team. He played his professional career for Sao Paulo from 1990-2015.</p>
