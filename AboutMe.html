<h1>About Me</h1>
    
<p>My name is Mason Rodgers and I am a 15 year old student at HHS, my passion has always been sports whether it was football, athletics, or cross country, but football has always stuck to me well I have let go of the other sports. I've been born and raised in New Zealand with my Mum, Dad, and two older brothers. I started my football career when I was 7, this was at Glen Eden UTD will all my friends from school, I quickly grew in love with the sport scoring 107 goals in my first ever season playing, and then after 3 seasons I had a total of 322 goals. This had made me realise that I sould try move to bigger, and better clubs where I could be challenged more, then when I started 11th grade I decided to join Waitemata FC. For this club I knew instantly I was surrounded by peoplethat would push me to be my very best, After being put in the first team the opponents were like I have never seen before. Fast forwarding to today, I have been at Waitemata for 5 years and I am very happy to be where I am in my footballing journey. </p>
